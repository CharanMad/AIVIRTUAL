# AI_Mouse-Keyboard and Virtual Keyboard

With the development technologies in the areas of augumented reality and devices that we use in our daily life,
these devices are becoming compact in the form of
Bluetooth or wireless technologies. This paper proposes an
AI virtual mouse system that makes use of the hand
gestures and hand tip detection for performing mouse
functions in the computer using computer vision. The
main objective of the proposed system is to perform
computer mouse cursor functions and scroll function
using a web camera or a built-in camera in the computer
instead of using a traditional mouse device. Hand gesture
and hand tip detection by using computer vision is used as
a HCI with the computer. With the use of the AI virtual
mouse system, we can track the fingertip of the hand
gesture by using a built-in camera or web camera and
perform the mouse cursor operations and scrolling
function and also move the cursor with it.
